To learn the basics of Aletheia, read the manpage and check out the controls by clicking the "Help" option in the menu, or by pressing the '?' key at any time. Use the 'j' and 'k' keys to page down or up, and 'q' to go back or quit. If you need voice feedback, hit 'd' followed by '#' to save your choice.

If you prefer a natural-sounding voice feedback, gtts-cli is part of the gTTS project (https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) that downloads voice clips based on the Google Assistant voice. It can be enabled via setting USE_GTTS and VOICE_ENABLED to true in ~/.aletheia/config
