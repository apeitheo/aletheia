Welcome to Aletheia 0.9.6!

The dependencies needed to run Aletheia are:

bash, pulseaudio-utils, calc, bc, gtts, espeak-ng, sox, ffmpeg, and mplayer

To learn the basics of Aletheia, read the manpage and check out the controls
by clicking the "Help" option in the menu, or by pressing the '?' key at any
time. Use the 'j' and 'k' keys to page down or up, and 'q' to go back or quit.
If you need voice feedback, hit 'd' followed by '#' and confirm to save.

Installation: ./install
Uninstallation: ./uninstall

These install to /usr/local by default. Use the DESTDIR environment variable to
install elsewhere.
